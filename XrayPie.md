# Introduction #

XrayPie is a collection of small code pieces to perform various tasks in protein crystallography.  These are written mainly as python or bash scripts, and thus should not require much setup other than downloading some extra python modules as indicated on Linux and MacOS.  As for Windows, it should be possible to run python scripts after installing python, but I personally do no testing of this kind.
